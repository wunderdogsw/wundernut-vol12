# Wunderdog and the Encrypted Parchment

*Autumn 2022*

(Find our other Wundernuts [here](https://github.com/wunderdogsw/wundernuts))

## Solve the parchment mystery!

A blank [parchment](./parchment.png) was found in the halls of Wunderwarts recently. The parchment is believed to contain secret spells (in English) written with invisible ink. They are probably encrypted. No known spells seem to work to decrypt it. We need your help to solve this mystery!

Can you write some code to translate the hidden and encrypted text back to muggle-readable form?
